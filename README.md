    Project in which I put into practice everything I have learned about flutter.
    using all kinds of widgets.

    Displays pokemon which are subdivided by their type (fire, earth, water and lightning).
    
    When you open the pokemon information screen it shows what type of pokemon it is, as well as a brief history of the pokemon and       some of its stas, it also has a section of evolutions.
